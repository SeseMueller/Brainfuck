# Brainfuck in Python

This repository contains a python-based Interpreter for the programming language Brainfuck as well as a python-based compiler for Brainfuck. 

The compiler first converts all Brainfuck instructions into C-Instructions and stores that as a file. Then, gcc is called via the command line and compiles the file into an executable.

There are two examples for the Compiler: Hello World and a Visualization of the Mandelbrot set, both of which I did not write.
